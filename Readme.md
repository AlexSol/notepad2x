## Supported Operating Systems:

* Vista, 7, 8, 8.1 and 10 both 32-bit and 64-bit

## Notes:

* If you find any bugs or have any suggestions for the implemented lexers (and **not** only)
  feel free to **provide patches/pull requests**. Without patches or pull requests chances are
  that nothing will be fixed/implemented.
* I'm interested in any **localization** of Notepad2.

You can use MSVC 2022 to build Notepad2-mod.
